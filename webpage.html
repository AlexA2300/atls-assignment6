    <h1>My Favorite Movie</h1>
    <p>I quite enjoy <strong>watching Aladdin Live-Action</strong> with my friends!
        One of my favorite actors is Will Smith, who acts in the
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6139732/" title="Aladdin Live-Action IMDB page">
            Aladdin Live-Action </a>.
        My favorite scene from the move is when Aladdin finds <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/">
            Genie, as portrayed by Will Smith</a>, in the Cave of Wonders.
